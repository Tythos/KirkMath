# KirkMath

Basic math library used by ArtemisLib for fundamental linear algebra.

This could be replaced with a little elbow grease by something more full-featured and standardized.

But we splice/track it here for historical purposes until Artemis is no longer dependent on it.

# TODO:

- [x] Fix or rewrite string formatters

- [ ] Adjust / improve SDL submodule inclusion (currently directly to headers only)
